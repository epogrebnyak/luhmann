Find a productive workflow to use knowledge cards.

Goal
----

My goal is to manage https://github.com/epogrebnyak/learn better. `learn` is a collection of my markdown notes on programming, data management and teaching of IT, unclassified and not categorised. 

I would like to:

- [ ] render my notes as a web site on Github pages
- [ ] add Github Actions script to build upon commit
- [ ] present a starting page, index.md or index.html
- [ ] sort or view notes by category, keyword or a tag

I attach less weight to:

- sticking to one specific tool for all my workflow
- better choice of a better theme/template for html

[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) seems a good 
philosophy. Coupled with some static generator, hope it can work well. 

### Non-goals and itches

- write own python package
- re-write someone else's package

What I learned so far
---------------------

- I can use https://github.com/eyeseast/python-frontmatter/ to manage markdown metadata ('front matter')
